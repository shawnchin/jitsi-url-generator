# jitsi-url-generator

See: https://shawnchin.github.io/jitsi-url-generator/

A simple UI that allows you to make simple customisations and watch how the URL changes. 
It only exposes a small fraction of what is possible with Jitis, but should hopefully help build familiarity which 
users can then apply to other config values in the whitelist.
